# VSCode Default Keybindings

This a keymap extension that allows you to use the default keybindings of Visual Studio Code from any other operating system.

It builds on the very useful [vs-code-default-keybindings](https://github.com/codebling/vs-code-default-keybindings) which it wraps up and provides simple configuration for.

## Usage

1. Install the extension.
2. Go to `Preferences` -> `Extensions` -> `VSCode Default Keybindings` and enable the keymap(s) you want to use.

There is also the option to clear the default keybindings for your current OS by using the `negative` keybindings from `vs-code-default-keybindings`.
